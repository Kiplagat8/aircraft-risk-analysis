# Aircraft-risk-analysis
This project is developed as part of a business venture where our company is expanding into the airline industry. The goal is to identify low-risk aircraft—suitable for both commercial and private use—by leveraging data science techniques on real-world aviation data.
Low-Risk Aircraft Selection Project

# **Objective**
To analyze aircraft safety and performance data from the National Transport Board, and identify aircraft models that present the lowest operational and safety risks for purchase.

Skills and Concepts Applied
Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing inconsistencies

Data Aggregation – Summarizing key statistics to compare aircraft types and models

Data Imputation – Estimating missing data to improve completeness

Data Visualization – Creating visual narratives to support decision-making

Insight Communication – Framing findings into a business story for non-technical stakeholders

Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebooks

Data from the National Transport Board

Outcome
By the end of this project, I deliver:

A cleaned and analyzed dataset

Visual insights comparing aircraft models

A business story and recommendations tailored for executive-level decision-makers
